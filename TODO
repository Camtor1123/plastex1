Since this package is still in early development, there is a lot to do
just for basic functionality.

Parsing
-------
- Finish DOM methods
- XPath
- Clean up \def parsing and expanding
- Use DocumentFragments in document building instead of lists
- Convert strings to nodes
- Reduce isinstace usage
- Write parsers for all LaTeX commands
- Develop a good LaTeX package API (LaTeX package -> Python package?)
- Create a LaTeX Document similar to a DOM Document 

Rendering
---------
- Figure out how to attach a renderer to the document
- Update SimpleTAL (see if it can be pulled out completely)
- Counters and labels
- ToCs
- Indexes
- Bibliography
