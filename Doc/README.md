# plasTeX documentation

The documentation in this directory is available in PDF and HTML format
at [plastex.github.io](http://plastex.github.io/plastex/).  

However you can compile it yourself using `make` in this folder. You can also
use `make html` or `make pdf` if you want to generate only one output format. 

Note for plasTeX contributors: in order to publish this documentation, one
needs to compile it, then move `plastex.pdf` to the generated `plastex` folder
containing the html version, and then move this folder to th `gh-pages` branch
at the root of the repository.
