\section{Installation}

You will need a decent python to use plasTeX, at least python 3.6 (note that
python versions older than 3.7 are no longer supported by the python software
foundation).
You can install plasTeX like any other python package, using
\sh{pip install plasTeX}
(or \sh{pip3} or \sh{pipx} depending on your setup).


If you want a cutting-edge version, you can download the most recent code using
git with
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git clone https://github.com/plastex/plastex.git
\end{lstlisting}
(or by hand at \href{https://github.com/plastex/plastex/zipball/master}{this url})
and then install it by running
\sh{python3 setup.py} in the plastex folder.

\section{HTML rendering}

\subsection{Basic rendering}

While plasTeX is a general purpose LaTeX document processing framework, its
most common use is to convert LaTeX documents to HTML web documents.
If your document \verb+my_doc.tex+Â does not use any complicated LaTeX package,
you can simply convert it by running
\verb+plastex my_doc.tex+

This will create a folder \verb+my_doc+ containing an HTML version of your document.

There are many command line options you can use to configure the way your document is rendered.
The most important one is probably \sh{--split-level=N} which specifies
the highest section level that generates a new file. Each section in a LaTeX
document has a number associated with its hierarchical level. These levels are
-2 for the document, -1 for parts, 0 for chapters, 1 for sections, 2 for
subsections, 3 for subsubsections, 4 for paragraphs, and 5 for subparagraphs. A
new file will be generated for every section in the hierarchy with a value less
than or equal to the value of this option. This means that for the default
value of 2, files will be generated for the document, parts, chapters,
sections, and subsections.

You can also remove the table of contents that appears on each page using
\sh{--no-display-toc}. If you keep this table of content you can use the
option \sh{--toc-depth=N} which specifies the number of levels to include.

If removing the table of contents is not sober enough, you can use the option
\sh{--theme=minimal} to get a bare-bone unstyled HTML file, or even
\sh{--theme=fragment} to get the content without any header, for later
inclusion into a complete HTML document.

They are dozens of other options described briefly when running \sh{plastex --help}
and with many more details in the
\href{http://plastex.github.io/plastex/plastex/sec-command-line.html}{documentation}.
Typing many command lines options is pretty boring so be sure to
read how to put them in a
\href{http://plastex.github.io/plastex/plastex/sec-general-options.html}{configuration file}.

\subsection{Rendering both in HTML and pdf}

If your document is meant to be rendered only by plasTeX then things are simple, but
this is not the most common case. In this section we will assume that you want to use
both plasTeX and a pdf-producing compiler such as \sh{pdflatex}, \sh{xelatex} or \sh{lualatex}.

If your document uses LaTeX packages that are not implemented in plasTeX,
various things can happen. If you are lucky and your package is simple, plasTeX
will manage to load it from its TeX source. If not, then the first thing to consider
is whether this complicated package makes sense for the HTML version.
Many sophisticated LaTeX packages aim to produce a beautiful pdf file in
a way that wouldn't make sense on a web page. In this case, the easiest
solution is to have two different preambles. A basic file layout is to have
a file \sh{content.tex} containing the actual content of your document and
is imported by two small TeX files, \sh{print.tex} for compilation by
a pdf producing compiler and \sh{web.tex} for compilation by plasTeX.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
% Inside file print.tex

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{fancy_complicated}

\newcommand{\stuff}{horrible hack torturing TeX boxes}

\begin{document}
  \input{content.tex}
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

And then

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
% Inside file web.tex

\documentclass{article}

\newcommand{\stuff}{simple version for the web}

\begin{document}
  \input{content.tex}
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

While this setup is the most versatile, you can try to keep everything
in the same file by using the \sh{ifplastex} special conditional.
In your TeX file you can include
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\newif\ifplastex
\plastexfalse
\end{lstlisting}
This declares a new conditional \verb+\ifplastex+. The second line sets it to false
but will be ignored by plasTeX because it recognizes this as a special case.
You can then write:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\ifplastex
  Some code to be parsed by plasTeX
\else
  Some code for every other TeX compiler
\fi
\end{lstlisting}

If the above two methods are not enough then you probably want to implement
some LaTeX packages as python packages for use by plasTeX. This is beyond the
scope of this tutorial but is
\href{http://plastex.github.io/plastex/plastex/sec-macros.html}{covered in the documentation}.

\subsection{Changing the way things are rendered}

There are many ways to influence the way plasTeX renders a LaTeX document to
a HTML file beyond what the command line options allow to do.
The easiest way is to add your own CSS file and tell plasTeX about it
using the \sh{extra-css} option, running for instance
\sh{plastex --extra-css my_style.css my_document.tex}.

Although CSS tweaks can completely change the appearance of a HTML document,
sometimes you also need to change the actual HTML code. The default HTML5 render
in plasTeX uses the \href{https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/}{Jinja}
templating language. For a very simple example, consider how the default
renderer handle a quote environment.
The \TeX\ code
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\begin{quote}
  Cogito ergo sum.
\end{quote}
\end{lstlisting}
produces the following HTML:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
<blockquote class="quote">Cogito ergo sum.</blockquote>
\end{lstlisting}
Let's say you don't like the blockquote tag and want to replace it with a div tag.
During parsing by plasTeX, the quote environment will be turned into an
instance of the Python \sh{quote}
class. Searching for \sh{quote} in the template folder
\href{https://github.com/plastex/plastex/tree/master/plasTeX/Renderers/HTML5}{plasTeX/Renderers/HTML5}
we find a file \sh{Quotations.jinja2s} containing:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
name: quote
<blockquote class="quote">{{ obj }}</blockquote>

name: quotation
<blockquote class="quotation">{{ obj }}</blockquote>

name: verse
<blockquote class="verse">{{ obj }}</blockquote>
\end{lstlisting}
The only Jinja syntax here is the \sh{\{\{ obj \}\}} which tells the template engine to render the
\sh{obj} variable, here our \sh{quote} instance. Say we would prefer a good old div tag.
We can create a modified version of this template file and put it inside some folder, say
\sh{my_templates} and then run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
plastex --extra-templates=my_templates my_doc.tex
\end{lstlisting}
Note that paths in this option are relative to the current directory.

You can also use this option to create a new theme. For instance you can create a
file \sh{my_templates/Themes/my_theme/default-layout.jinja2} taking inspiration
from the
\href{https://github.com/plastex/plastex/tree/master/plasTeX/Renderers/HTML5/Themes/default}{minimal theme}
or the
\href{https://github.com/plastex/plastex/tree/master/plasTeX/Renderers/HTML5/Themes/default}{default theme}
depending on whether you prefer starting with a mostly blank slate or tweak the
full blown default theme.
You can then run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
plastex --extra-templates=my_templates --theme=my_theme my_doc.tex
\end{lstlisting}
to use your new layout.
