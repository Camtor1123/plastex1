##Â  Testing

We run our tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/),
although many of our tests were written long before pytest was written. 
As usual with pytest, no much will work as expected if you don't install
the package you want to test. So the first step is to run 
`pip install .` in the toplevel folder of this repository, the one
containing `setup.py` (as usual, depending on your python setup, `pip`
could be called `pip3`, and you may need administration permissions if
you want to make a system-wide install). 
If you want to quickly modify code and retest, it is more convenient to
use "editable install", by running `pip install -e .` which creates a
link to your working copy of plasTeX instead of copying it (see 
[pip's documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)
if needed).
Once plasTeX is installed, you can run `pytest` from the toplevel
folder.

Our continuous integration tests plasTeX using python 3.6 to 3.11. 
This can be done locally using
[tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For this you need `tox`
of course, but also various versions of python. One convenient way
to ensure that is to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
After setting up `pyenv` and installing, say python 3.6.8,
3.7.2, 3.8.0, 3.9.0, 3.10.0, 3.11.0 (using `pyenv install 3.5.6` etc.), you can
create, inside the toplevel folder of your working copy of plasTeX, a file
`.python-version` containing
```
3.11.0
3.10.0
3.9.0
3.8.0
3.7.2
3.6.8
```
Then you can run `tox` to run our test suite against all those versions
of python.
